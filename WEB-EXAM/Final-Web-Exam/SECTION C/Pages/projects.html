        <h3>PROJECT 1</h3>
        <p>Farming is the back bone of our country and you reap where you saw <br>
            i started up farming coz its educative i learnt alot from farming <br>
            and ive earned from it. I started up farmiing as my project because  <br>
            it yields and someone could earn from it. In addition,i also did <br>
            poultry to ad on my sales and productivity. <br>
            Poultry is educative as well and one could really earn from it. <br>

    <h3>PROJECT 2</h3>
    <p>Painting is like a description of something or someone. <br>
        i started up painting as my project because it could speak <br>
        alot of what i was going through.I didnt have to introduce <br>
        myself or speak for my art. It spoke for its self. <br>
